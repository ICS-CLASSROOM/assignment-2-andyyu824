A naive method for determining whether two documents are similar is to treat them as collections of words (bag of words) and use the number of words they share as a proxy for their similarity. It makes sense that two books with religion as the topic (e.g.  `398.txt` and `3296.txt`) would have more words in common than a book that discusses religion and a book that discusses science fiction (e.g. books `84.txt` and `398.txt`). \n",

    "No, based on the above, it does not appear that counting the number of shared words is a good idea as a distance metric for evaluating topic similarity. Even if there is sometimes domain specific vocabulary, there will almost certainly still be a significant overlap in words even if they are not stop words. Book 84 (Frankenstein) and 3296 (Confessions of Saint Augustine) were supposedly written over a 1000 years apart from one another and are very different genres/topics, but once written in English they will share vocabulary in dialogue, world building, monologuing, pleads to God (which may be something specific these both have in common), etc."
