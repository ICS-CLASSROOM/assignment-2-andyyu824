    "The task of identifying similar texts in Natural Language Processing is crucial. A naive method for determining whether two documents are similar is to treat them as collections of words (bag of words) and use the number of words they share as a proxy for their similarity. It makes sense that two books with religion as the topic (e.g.  `398.txt` and `3296.txt`) would have more words in common than a book that discusses religion and a book that discusses science fiction (e.g. books `84.txt` and `398.txt`). \n",

Even if there is sometimes domain specific vocabulary, there will almost certainly still be a significant overlap in words even if they are not stop words. Book 84 (Frankenstein) and 3296 (Confessions of Saint Augustine) were supposedly written over a 1000 years apart from one another and are very different genres/topics, but once written in English they will share vocabulary in dialogue, world building, monologuing, pleads to God (which may be something specific these both have in common), etc.\n",

Book 398 has roughly a third of their word lengths so there are fewer chances for overlapping vocabulary. Even if 398 and 3296 should be more similar, the word counts becoming a deceiving metric for similarity if word counts are very different."

    "The results from taking the Euclidean distances for evaluating similarity are not what I expected. By comparing all books via the intersection of words between all four books, it worked around the problem with similarity via word count. With that in mind, I expected Euclidean distance to accurately reflect similarity between two books when measured by this intersection of words between all books. However, books 398 and 3296 which both talk about religion are further apart in projected space than books 84 and 398 are. This is surprising and assuming my numbers/calculations are correct, it shows the Euclidean distance may not be an accurate means for evaluating topic relatedness across documents. At the very least, it does not work as we have used it. Perhaps further filtering the intersection of words by adding book_43 into the mix skewed our results. We did not compare book_43 with the other books, so I do not see why we took it into consideration when identifying similarity between the other three books. By adding book_43 and further filtering the words, we remove domain specific words from consideration and the vocabulary shared is only general language."

    "Something Dr. Belcaid proposes for improving identifying similarity between documents is using rare/keywords rather than more frequent words. The idea being that highly domain specific phrases are probably rare, but they hold greater weight in deciphering the genre of a text. For this, he proposed Log-frequency weighting of words where we dampen the weight of a word as frequency increases. Now weight of a word in considering domain/genre/similairty still increases with frequency of the word in the text, but really popular general non-stop words no longer overpower more obscure possibly domain specific words."

    "Looking at the linear regression, it appears that there may be a slight correlation between departure delays and arrival delays, but considering the slope is 0.0008089067382794703 when y values can be either 0 or 1, I would say that the correlation is very weak. This is not a surprise to me considering that I have been on many flights with delayed departures but even early arrivals. From my research, it appears that there are multiple factors to consider regarding flight time and two major ones are weather and fuel consumption. A delayed flight can make up time with better than expected weather or increasing speed of the plane and fuel consumption. Increasing fuel consumption will cost airlines but so could causing a chain reaction of delayed flights so it may be worth the extra fuel consumption to make up for slight delays."
